- **`<nav>`**: Contains the navigation links for easy access to different sections.

- **`<footer>`**: Marks the footer section that contains site-wide information and links.

- **Custom Classes**: For more specific styles not covered by Tailwind, custom CSS classes are used to achieve the desired look.

## üöÄ Lighthouse Performance

![Purchasing a Domain](assets/screenshot/lighthouse.PNG)
This website has been tested using Google Lighthouse, and here are the results:

- **Performance**: 99
- **Accessibility**: 100
- **Best Practices**: 100
- **SEO**: 100

These results indicate that the website performs well across various metrics, including load speed, accessibility for users with disabilities, adherence to best practices, and SEO optimization.

### Why Performance is 99:

The Performance score of 99 reflects excellent load speed and overall user experience, but it is slightly impacted by render-blocking resources. Specifically, external CSS files (e.g., Tailwind CSS and FontAwesome) are blocking the first paint of the page, which can delay content visibility.

This minor delay in rendering is the primary reason the performance score is not a perfect 100, though the website still performs exceptionally well.
